<https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8211251>`__:

    CoreOS is hiring in a number of engineers that are passionate about
    infrastructure and open source software.

    Distributed Systems- Help make distributed systems easy. You’ll be
    working on our open source projects, etcd and fleet. etcd is being
    widely adopted by many different projects, including Pivotal’s Cloud
    Foundry and Google's Kubernetes, but it is still a very early
    project and we need help.

    OS- Writing a hobbiest kernel on the weekend? Contributed to Gentoo
    in 2005? Hacking on the core of CoreOS might right up your ally. The
    OS team is responsible for CoreOS itself, building, patching, and
    architecting the future of linux on the server. We work very closely
    with upstream, contributing patches to Linux itself, systemd,
    docker, and any other component that’ll make CoreOS more successful
    for our users.

    Backend Web- Outside of building a new OS and a new distributed
    database (etcd), we are also building backend web services. If you
    have an interest in systems, but expertise in backend web
    development, please consider CoreOS. Our architecture is a Go based
    json/http API app server, coupled Angular on the frontend.

    We are hiring for full-time in SF or NYC. **If you are interested,
    please email our CEO directly with your resume or LinkedIn:
